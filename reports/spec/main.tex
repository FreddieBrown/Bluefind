When an emergency situation occurs, people want to tell others where they are and get help. 
This can often be difficult to do because key infrastructure that is heavily relied on could be damaged.
Situations around the world show there is a significant need for systems to help peope connect with no, or very little, working cellular infrastructure. 
By using commodity hardware in our devices, survivors can oppurtunistically send information to nearby devices. 
This could then be sent to an internet connected device for transmission, other nearby devices or, the emergency services. 
Moving information in emergency situations could get alert those who save lives and could aid rescue efforts.
